# Transects
Create a set of windows perpendicular to a given line shapefile. Included is an example shapefile that runs along the Himalaya. Use from the command line with: 

python Transects_From_Line.py Himalaya_Arc.shp Boxes.shp 0.5 0.05 1 100

Where 0.5 is the box width, 0.05 is the box overlap, 1 is the box length (size perpendicular to the line), and 100 is the maximum number of polygons to create.
